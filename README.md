# DOSE Developer Coding Challenge


## Introducing DOSE Digital Assistant

For this coding challenge you're going to take on Siri, Alexa, and Google!

Create a single page web application that takes a voice command such as "DOSE, show me music" or "DOSE, show me food".  The application will then redirect the user to the appropriate tag page on dose.com : [music](https://dose.com/tagged/music), [food](https://dose.com/tagged/food)

It turns out you won't exactly be taking on Google for this challange as you'll be using one of their products for the voice recognition part of it.  [API.AI](https://api.ai/) is a free service that provides voice recognition capabilities via an API.  You'll need to create a free account there and then get started with the appropriate [SDK](https://docs.api.ai/docs/sdks).

## Execting the program

Step 1: Clone the project locally using git clone or download the folder from the current fork
Step 2: Pull the latest code (in case you already have the repository cloned)
Step 3: Do "npm install" to install all the required packages in your console
Step 4: Do "grunt dev" to install bower components, build the project and run it.
Step 5: Open "localhost:8080" in your browser. You should see a screen which has a button to speak and some exmaple commands.
